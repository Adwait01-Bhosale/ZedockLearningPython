# ZedockLearningPython
Repository for Python learning projects.

## Who I am?
I could describe my self as a hobbyist who want to learn to code.
I'm not pro developer and I'm just learning how to code with Python.
I have some prior knowledge from other coding languages like Java and Javascript.
I'm also familiar with HTML and CSS but as I already said I'm not a developer yet.

## What is this repository for?
In this repository I will store my learning projects. 
First I will write simple programs to learn Python syntax and then I will move forward to more complex programs.
At last I hope I could code some useful programs with Python. 

This all is just for fun and learning purposes. Maybe one day I'm a developer who can do something useful with skills of coding.
